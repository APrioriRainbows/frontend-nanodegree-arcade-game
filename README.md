===============================

Game Overview:
This is a class frogger-style arcade game. It is written in ES6 syntax, which means that you'll need a modern browser to run it.
To play a live demo just open [this link](http://apriorirainbows.com/public/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/) on a standard computer browser. This game is not currently responsive or mobile compatible.

How to Play:
Use the left, right, up, and down arrow keys to move the hero (cat girl) around the board. The enemies move left to right along the stone 'lanes'.
Your player is safe on the grass, but once on the stones will need to avoid the enemies in their lane. The enemies move at different speeds, so keep this in mind. To win the game you should avoid all enemies and reach the water. You will need to forward, or step into, the water to trigger the win condition.
